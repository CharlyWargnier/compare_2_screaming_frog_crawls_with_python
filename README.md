This Colab notebook allows you to compare two Screaming Frog crawls and outputs summary tables and charts of all the differences.

Credit due to Alessio Nittoli [(@Nittolese)](https://https://twitter.com/nittolese) for creating the initial script. 

Besides these summary tables and charts, Iâ€™ve taken the script further by adding the following functionalities:

*   You can now select the type of content you want to compare by:
   - discarding redirects
   - discarding non-HTML elements (application, PDFs, images etc.) to only focus on HTML URLs

*   More [Colab forms](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/forms.ipynb) for easier parameterisation.
*   Additional guidance for newcomers.
